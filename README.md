# Braive Project

## Background

At Braive, we’re reinventing mental health care with innovative digital solutions. Our mission is to empower patients and support clinicians with effective, personalised treatment paths. We’re committed to making mental wellness accessible for all. [Braive Website](https://braive.com/)

Our platform provides tools for clinicians and their patients to work with mental health, such as:
- **Mental Health Check:** A diagnostic tool with questions to assess severity and symptoms.
- **iCBT Programs:** Normally 8-12 modules of psychoeducation, tools, and assignments (all named “activities” in the dataset).
- **Tests:** Patients answer tests at the beginning of each new module, allowing clinicians and Braive to measure symptom development.

We serve various companies, each having clinicians connected to them. Most patient users have a clinician supporting them, but some also work on the programs independently. In our dataset, `guided` refers to patients with a clinician, and `unguided` to those without a clinician.

## Purpose of the Assignment

The goal of this assignment is to gain insights into our users’ progress in the programs and/or how much time they spend on our platform. Given the limited amount of data, the analysis will be based solely on the provided dataset.

## Approach

Due to the time constraints of this assignment, I prioritized the analysis of user engagement over time, enrollment trends, platform preferences, and course completion rates. This approach was chosen to provide a broad overview of user behavior and highlight key areas for further investigation.

## Conclusions

1. **User Activity:**
   - Out of 22,000 users enrolled, approximately 64% are inactive, having spent no time on the platform.

2. **Enrollment Trends:**
   - There was a notable increase in enrollments in 2020; however, 94% of these users spent 0 minutes on the platform.
   - A substantial increase in user engagement was observed in 2021, with further massive improvements in 2022, and the trend remains consistent in 2023.

3. **Platform Preferences:**
   - Customers predominantly prefer using the Web to access the platform.

4. **Top Courses by Time Spent:**
   - **Stress and Burnout**
   - **Braive Couples**
   - **Depression and Social Anxiety**
   - **Short Program: Sleep**
   - **Mental Skills Training for Youth: For Trainers**

5. **Course Completion Rates:**
   - **Multi Knee Mental Skills Training** and **Short Program Thoughts** are the only courses where the number of users completing the course is greater than those who haven't.
   - Top 5 courses by course completion users:
     - **Mental Skills Training for Youth**
     - **Work and Life in Balance**
     - **Worry and Anxiety**
     - **Depression and Anxiety**
     - **Depression and Sadness**
